      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I want to send a message people with a passion for fashion, but may not 
        have the means to support the growth of a conventional wardrobe. I want 
        to contribute to a change in the view that fashion has to be new or luxury. 
        Second hand fashion is a great way to express yourself, give life to an old 
        piece of clothing, and subsequently reduce the environmental impact of 
        discarded clothing. Did you know that the amount of textile waste created 
        annually is an estimated 92 million tons? By inspiring fashion-oriented 
        individuals to pursue this kind of reuse, the emotional and environmental 
        effects abound. I would love to create a blog where there is a community 
        that is passionate about second hand fashion, and a community that cares 
        about the world we live in, even if it is a residual idea from becoming 
        more involved in the second hand community.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        I want to market towards college age, teens to young adults. I want to 
        reach people who are just beginning to understand and know who they really
        are, and are can share in the feeling of becoming an adult. I want to connect
        with a population of people who care.

        Commitment to nature: <br>
        Every year, nearly <a href="https://goodonyou.eco/waste-luxury-fashion/">13 million tons</a>
        of textile waste is discarded into landfills, and this is only partially 
        due to commercial retailers. The average citizen of the Earth plays a large 
        role in the generation of textile waste, and there is something we can do 
        about it, and if you're here, you'll like the solution! No doubt that ever
        since you were small, you knew what the thrift store was, or you dreaded 
        that the only new clothes you would get that year would be from your older 
        siblings. Well the era of being embarrassed by secondhand clothing is coming 
        to a close. Not only is shopping for or wearing secondhand clothing minimizing 
        the impact we have on the Earth, but it is also a cheap ticket to feeling 
        confident in your second skin: what you wear. The way we dress is much more 
        important than we may realize (you can read more about this phenomenon 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/clothes-and-self-perception.html">here</a>).
        By even just encouraging others to think more about secondhand options, <i>you</i> 
        can be the beginning of a new era for our Earth and for yourself. Feeling 
        confident in your own skin (your first, and second ;)) is a priority that we 
        often push aside because of the events and situations outside of us telling us 
        that our self-esteem can wait, but it is important to realize that a better 
        world for all of us begins with the only person that we can truly make choices 
        for--ourselves.

      <h3>Blog -- Who am I?</h3>
      <p>
        Hello beautiful people, I'm Jojo! I'm a connoisseur of everything second 
        hand fashion has always been an important part of my life, even if I 
        wasn't necessarily up to date with the trends, the way I dressed was 
        always a way that I could show people who I was without saying it outright. 
        I was a relatively silent child, and only really began speaking when I was 
        in middle school, but the way I dressed always gave me the voice I often 
        felt like I didn't have. 
      </p>
      <p>Though fashion is a passion of mine, it isn't the only thing that makes 
          me who I am! I love so many things and flit from hobby to hobby—as I've 
          noticed has become quite normal for my generation—but there are a couple 
          things that have really stuck with me! I love crocheting, knitting and 
          sewing, rock climbing, writing stories and poems (as a journaling device :D), 
          and scrapbooking. I feel like a lot of these hobbies translate well to my 
          passion, so I think it's a good fit! But you might be saying, where does 
          rock climbing fit in? Well, it doesn't necessarily “fit in,” but I do like 
          to get creative with my climbing outfits sometimes as well! That's what I 
          love so much about styling yourself—anywhere you go, you can show people 
          who you are without having to say it!
      </p>
      <p>
          I have three siblings and a mom and dad who I adore, and of course, there's 
          also my baby, Ollie! We adopted Oliver almost 7 years ago, and he'll be 
          eight in December. He is the love and light of my life, and being away from 
          him for college is very difficult, but I have to keep in mind that he would 
          love the growth that I am experiencing while I'm here, even if he doesn't 
          get to see me half the year. Ollie is a big part of my life, and so is my 
          family, so of course they would need to be in my about me post! I'm the 
          youngest of 4 awesome kiddos (who aren't so much kiddos anymore ;D), and I 
          would say one of my best friends is my brother, the second youngest. Out of 
          the four, we've had the most time to grow up together, and he's taught me so 
          much in my short 18 years. My mom and my dad are amazing too, they are the 
          kind of people to instantly adopt anyone who walks through their door, loving 
          them quickly and without judgment (me and my brother call them saints, but 
          they refuse the title—too humble! xD). My older two siblings are like a second 
          set of parents to me. Even though I don't see them very often anymore, 
          they've both taught me so much, and I wouldn't trade them for anyone else in 
          the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
          I could talk all I want about myself, on and on about my awesome friends, my 
          life, my dog, how much I've grown as a person, etc etc, but what I really find 
          important about starting this website is encouraging others to look at the good 
          in their lives. I've always loved journaling, and the first thing I always 
          suggest to people wanting to journal is to begin to write stories about your 
          own life—how you remember things, how your life has changed, what you do that 
          makes you, you, and how that effects your self esteem. I am always in a place 
          of trying to become a better me, and even if it slows me down for just a second, 
          I know that I am growing and stretching my physical, emotional, and mental muscles, 
          and I can attest that even through all the hard times, I feel like I get stronger 
          everyday, physically, emotionally, and mentally; even though sometimes my 'muscles' 
          can feel 'sore.'
